				      My name is Ramon. Me and Andreas work on Moz Analytics,
				      a software as a service tool that you can use to manage all your SEO and inbound marketing efforts.
				      We are going to talk today about Socket.io, what is it, what can it be used for
				      and we'll give you a real example of how we use it here at Moz.

					<h1>What is Socket.IO?</h1>
					<iframe src="http://weplay.io" width="100%" height="480" scrolling="no" class=" fragment iframe-class" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<aside class="notes">
						Socket.io is a real time engine based on Web Sockets that allows you build event-based services.
						What does that mean? You don't need to use long polling or fire multiple AJAX requests per second any more.

						Probably, you have heard about Socket.io and seen how to use it in sexy applications like chat services, binary streaming or even in a multiplayer recreation of Pok√©mon.

						This all looks really cool and all right?, but now you may be wondering how you can use socket.io in my project. I am going to try to give you some pointers as to when you can use it.

					<h2> 1 - Request/Response?</h2>
					<image class="fragment roll-in" width='500' src='http://www.pubnub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WebSockets2.png'>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment roll-in"> Logging </li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in"> Custom Real Time Tracking </li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in"> Loading bars or spinners </li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Firstly, Socket.io would be the perfect tool to use when you don't require a request/response format.As long as the WebSocket connection is open, you can send messages with a small overhead. So this is perfect for when you want to send a msg from the client or server and you do not expect a response.
				    Let me give you a couple examples. For example, when you want to send client logs to your server
				    to sotre or parse them.

				    Another use case would be if you want to enable real time tracking like clicks or even every position of the mouse. In all these cases you don't need any response back. You are just sending the message. Another example would be a loading bar. The client just
				    get the status update from the server but it doesn't need to respond.

					<h2> 2 - Sporadic Server Push</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment roll-in"> In app messages </li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in"> Notifications </li>
					</ul>
					<div class='fragment' width='100%'>
						<img width='500' src="http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/36b/953/478/resized/x-x-everywhere-meme-generator-notifications-notifications-everywhere-5982f8.jpg" alt="Colons">
				  </div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Another use case is when you need a server to contact the client every now and then as a result of an
						asynchronous event.
						For a long time, you have probably used long polling or tools like Comet to simulate a server push.
						Luckily, those times are over.
						A perfect example would be the in app notification or messages that apps like LinkedIn,
						Facebook or twitter do.

					<h2> Problem</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						How do we use sockets at Moz? Let me give you a bit of context about some problems we face.
						As you may know, we have tools that gather information from a website and return information about the domain once some operation is completed. Until now, the users only get information after the whole operation has finished, usually minutes or even hours later.

						We realised that the users don't want to trigger a report and then wait for long, they want real time feedback. Any piece of feedback right now is more
						valuable and actionable than 10 a week later.

					<aside class="notes">
						Here is where socket.Io comes into play. We use socket.IO to receive real time messages kgknand refresh the UI the moment they happen. Now, Andreas is going to show code and discuss the details about the implementation.

					<h2>Demo</h2>
					<iframe src="http://chat.socket.io" width="100%" height="480" scrolling="no" class=" fragment iframe-class" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's take a look at the classic chat example. You can find the source on the socket.io site.

						Instead the client awkwardly polling at a certain interval, new messages are pushed instantly.

						No more clumsy webchats that keep refreshing while you try to copy and paste something.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Architecture</h2>
					<ul style="width:100%;">
						<li class="fragment roll-in">Open connection and setup events
						</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">Send message: 'Run report'
							<pre>Report started</pre>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">On Report Status
							<pre>status: enqueued</pre>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">On Report Status
							<pre>status: running</pre>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">On Report Status
							<pre>status: finished</pre>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Currently, to run a report, we make an AJAX request, get a report ID back, then poll repeatedly to check the status.
						Eventually, it's either done or errorred out. Finally we make a last request to fetch the actual report.

						Gets the job done, but is certainly not very elegant and it puts an extra load on the server to re-check the status.

						For a JavaScript developer, working with socket.io should feel quite natural, as it is event driven.
						The difference is there isn't a 1:1 mapping as there is with a request and a callback.

						Instead after opening a connection and sending an initial message or request, you may get multiple responses back.

					<h2>Client Side Setup</h2>
					<pre><code data-trim>
@socket = io()
@socket.on 'reportStatus', (msg) => @onReportStatus msg
@socket.emit 'startReport',
  keyword: @get 'keyword'
  clientId: @get 'id'
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						socket.io makes it very simple, removes just about all of the boilerplate you would otherwise need.
						And it has a fallback in case your browser doesn't support websockets yet.

						3 simple steps:
							- connect to the server
							- listen for any messages you expect just like regular event handlers
							- open a connection by sending a message

					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Server Side Setup</h2>
					<pre><code data-trim>
# Websocket
server.app.io.on 'connection', (socket) ->
  clients.addConnection socket

# Clients class
addConnection: (socket) ->
  socket.on 'disconnect', => @removeConnection socket
  socket.on 'startReport', (args) => @startReport socket, args

onReportStatus: (status) ->
  @socket.emit 'reportStatus', status
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						Similar simple setup:
							- handle opening a connection
							- make sure to handle disconnection
							- provide the api for the client
							- send data back to the client
